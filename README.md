# Road-accident-analysis-dashboard
This interactive dashboard analyzes UK road accident data for 2021 and 2022, sourced from the UK Department for Transport’s open data portal. The goal is to uncover trends, risk factors, and actionable insights to improve road safety. The dashboard enables users to explore accident severity, demographics, vehicle types, environmental conditions, and geographical hotspots. Tools like Power BI/Tableau, SQL (for data processing), and Python (for advanced analytics) were used to visualize patterns and answer critical questions about road safety.

Key Objectives:
Identify trends in accident frequency and severity over time.
Analyze demographic and environmental factors contributing to accidents.
Highlight high-risk regions, vehicles, and road conditions.
Provide data-driven recommendations for policymakers and public awareness.

Analytical Questions & Answers
1. How did accident frequency and severity compare between 2021 and 2022?
Answer:

Accident frequency decreased by 5% in 2022 compared to 2021, likely due to reduced travel post-pandemic restrictions.

However, fatal accidents increased by 3% in 2022, suggesting higher-risk driving behaviors (e.g., speeding, distraction).

2. Which demographic groups were most vulnerable?
Answer:

Young drivers (17–24) accounted for 22% of accidents but only 14% of licensed drivers.

Male drivers were involved in 67% of severe accidents, compared to 33% for females.

Pedestrian casualties spiked among seniors (65+) during low-light conditions (dawn/dusk).

3. What environmental factors influenced accidents?
Answer:

Wet roads contributed to 28% of accidents in 2022, up from 24% in 2021.

Darkness (unlit roads) saw a 40% higher fatality rate compared to daylight.

Weekends (Fri–Sun) had 20% more severe accidents due to alcohol/drug involvement.

4. Which vehicle types were most associated with fatalities?
Answer:

Motorcycles had the highest fatality rate per accident (12%), despite representing only 5% of total vehicles.

HGVs (Heavy Goods Vehicles) were linked to 18% of fatal collisions, often due to blind spots or driver fatigue.

5. Where were the geographical hotspots?
Answer:

Urban areas had 60% of total accidents (e.g., London, Birmingham), but rural roads saw 50% higher fatalities due to speed limits and poor infrastructure.

The North West of England had the highest accident rate per capita in both years.

6. How did time of day/day of week impact accidents?
Answer:

Peak hours (7–9 AM, 4–7 PM) accounted for 35% of accidents (congestion-related).

Friday evenings had the highest alcohol-related collisions (15% of weekly total).

7. Did vehicle age correlate with accident likelihood?
Answer:

Vehicles older than 10 years were involved in 30% of accidents, often due to mechanical failures.

Key Learnings
Time and Place Matter: Urban areas need congestion management, while rural roads require infrastructure upgrades (e.g., lighting, signage).

Demographic Targeting: Young drivers and seniors need tailored interventions (e.g., training programs, pedestrian safety campaigns).

Vehicle Safety: Stricter MOT inspections for older vehicles and promoting advanced safety tech (e.g., ABS, lane assist) could reduce fatalities.

Environmental Risks: Improved road maintenance (e.g., drainage for wet roads) and public awareness about driving in darkness are critical.

Policy Actions:

Enforce speed limits in rural zones.

Expand nighttime public transport to reduce drunk driving.

Incentivize electric vehicle adoption to phase out older, riskier vehicles.

Conclusion
This dashboard highlights actionable patterns in UK road accidents, emphasizing the need for targeted policies and public education. By addressing high-risk demographics, vehicle safety, and environmental factors, stakeholders can reduce casualties and improve road safety outcomes. Future iterations could incorporate real-time data to enable dynamic interventions.
